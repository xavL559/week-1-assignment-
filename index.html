    <p>What do you hope to learn in your CSS course?</p>
    <p>What i hope to learn in this css course is how to use css better and how to get comfortable using it</p>
   <p>Another thing to learn is how to get the hang of moving my images, text around to an area where i want them</p>
   <p>The last thing i want to learn is how to make my webpages like more better and not basic using css so i would like to know more stuff about css to make my pages look better</p>
